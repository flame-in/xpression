        <p class="font-italic">Sentiment Analysis is a rapidly growing domain in Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing 
            which helps in analysing and classifying emotion from textual data. 
            This project aims to create a product research application with the aid of sentiment analysis that can predict the 
            likelihood that a product is bought by a customer i.e., how well perceived and reviewed a product is, 
            based on social media posts such as Twitter tweets. This will help a user get an impression about the product, 
            or allow a business to target a particular customer or demographic more efficiently and boost sales for their product. 
            Twitter is searched for relevant tweets and users related to a product in question. The data will be collected and pre-processed; 
            genuine information will be kept in a database and the rest will be filtered out using some natural language processing techniques. 
            Statistical analysis and sentimental scoring are done to this final data using machine learning methods to find the general perception 
            of a product among customers. The web interface will allow users to view detailed graphs, charts and word clouds generated from the 
            processed data, along with relevant information pertaining to the product.</p>
